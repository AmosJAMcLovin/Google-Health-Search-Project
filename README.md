## Project Goal
Google Trends data allows us to see what people are searching for at a very local level. The goal of this project is to track, and visualize the top searches for common health issues in the United States, from Cancer to Diabetes, and compare them with the actual location of occurrences for those same health conditions to understand how search data reflects life for millions of Americans.

## Research Question
How have the most searched diseases changed over the years in the US?

## Data sources

## Data cleaning and visualization 
Python Jupyter Notebook was used in cleaning the data. This project makes use of Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, D3, Plotly and SQL database PostgreSQL for analysis and visualisation

## Data Analysis 
The possible visualization & comparisons to be made include the following:
* Health Search Volume by Year (Single Line Chart)
* Health Search Volume by Year and Condition (Multiple Line Chart)
* Health search Volume by State and Region (Choropleth map)
* Health Search volume by Location, Year and Condition (Comparison dashboard includes menu, dropdown, gauge and bar chart) 
* Correlation Between Health Conditions
* Correlation Between Health Conditions versus the Actual People dying through the years
